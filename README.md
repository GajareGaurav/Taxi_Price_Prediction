Description:
This project focuses on predicting taxi fare amounts based on various factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, passenger count, and pickup time. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate taxi fares, which can be valuable for both taxi service providers and customers in planning and budgeting for rides.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., creating new features from pickup time), and data visualization.
Model selection: Comparing different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting) to find the best performer.
Hyperparameter tuning: Using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the model for better performance.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared (R2) on both training and test datasets.
Feature importance: Determining the most important features that contribute to predicting taxi fares.
Technologies Used:

Python
pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning
matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Conclusion:
The final model achieved a high R-squared score on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting taxi fares. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in the transportation industry and its potential to optimize pricing strategies and improve customer experience.

Future Improvements:

Incorporating additional features such as weather data, traffic conditions, and special events to enhance the model's predictive power.
Deploying the model as a service to provide real-time fare estimates for taxi customers.
